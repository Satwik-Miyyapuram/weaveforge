/**
 * The Rust core (crates/wf-wasm) for TypeScript.
 *
 * wasm-bindgen's raw exports return `any`. Each is re-exported here with the
 * type that crates/wf-bindings generated from the Rust struct into
 * ./bindings.ts. This file declares no types of its own, and every raw export
 * has a wrapper here; test/index.test.ts checks both.
 *
 * The `as` in each wrapper is unchecked, so every wrapper needs a test that
 * checks the runtime value against its type, like the `coreInfo` one.
 *
 * Call `init` (browser, fetches the .wasm) or `initSync` (bytes in hand, e.g.
 * Node) once before any other export.
